"Project Description 

\nThis project analyzes and compares data on the population, precipitation
and wars in 196 countries. The overall goal is to see whether or not
there is a strong link between precipitation and population as well as
precipitation and wars. The result of this study can influence the
way we view our environment as a whole and the way we see major environmental
issues such as global warming as contributors to population decline and world conflicts

\nIn order to analyze and compare the three datasets mentioned
above (Precipitation, Population and Wars), we will need to group all datasets
by country names and dates. But before we can do that, we have to make the
names and dates uniformed. After grouping all the datasets by country and
year, we will then plot those data to see their latitudinal and longitudinal
locations. Once we have done these, we can use the sidebar panels to set some
parameters (ie. display datasets by spepific year and/or by country) to see the
relationship/s between the datasets better

\nThe datasets used in this study come from the Harvard Dataverse and Oregon State Univeristy, linked
